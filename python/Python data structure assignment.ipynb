    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "     Comments are used to add explanatory notes or remarks within the code. These comments are not executed as part of the program and are intended solely for human readers to better understand the code. \n",
    "    1. Single Line COmeents. e.g. print(\"Hello, World!\") \n",
    "    2. Double line comments. e.g. '''\n",
    "                                     This is a multi-line comment.\n",

    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-->> \n",
    "        \n",
    "        In Python, variables are used to store data values. They act as placeholders or containers that can hold various types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. Variables allow you to give names to these values, making it easier to work with data and manipulate it in your code.\n",
    "     Declaring and assigning values to variables in Python is straightforward. You don't need to specify the variable's data type explicitly; Python determines the data type automatically based on the value assigned. Here's the general syntax to declare and assign values to variables:\n",
    "     variable_name = value\n",
    "            Here, variable_name is the name of the variable, and value is the data you want to assign to the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "     examples:\n",
    "Example 1: Assigning a number to a variable\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 3.14\n",

    "Example 2: Assigning a string to a variable\n",

    "          In Python, you can convert one data type to another using various built-in functions. \n",

    "Q4. How do you write and execute a Python script from the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.4. To write and execute a Python script from the command line, follow these steps:\n",
    "       Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or any code editor of your choice) and create a new file. \n",
    "   1. Write your Python code in this file and save it with a .py extension. For example, you can save it as myscript.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Write your Python code inside the script. For example, let's create a simple script that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:\n",
    "      python# myscript.py\n",
    "      print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "   3.Open a terminal or command prompt on your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4.Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script using the cd command (change directory).\n",
    "     For example, if your script is saved on the desktop, use the following command (on Windows):\n",
    "    cd C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop.\n",
    "   5.Once you are in the correct directory, execute the Python script using the python command followed by the script's filename:\n",
    "     python myscript.py\n",
    "     For example, using the script we created earlier, you would run:\n",
    "     python myscript.py\n",
    "     After running the command, the Python interpreter will execute your script, and you will see the output in the terminal:\n",
    "     Hello, World!\n"
